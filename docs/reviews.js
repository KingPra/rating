CA body shop fixed the frame for much much less and did a great job. Great customer service as well. I really recommend it if you are paying for repairs out of your pocket.",rating:5},{name:"Louisburg Square",review:"I took my Hyundai Genesis to Carlos after it was two years old. It had front end damage to bumper and under carriage. Also right side wheels were badly scratched. Carlos provided a timely estimate of the work and explained the estimate clearly. I arranged to drop off my car to get the work done after the parts arrived. Carlos finished the job in the time advertised. He returned my phone calls promptly when I called to get updates along the way. The car looked fabulous, like it was brand new. A year ago I purchased a new Genesis G80 Sport and shortly after having the car the driver side fender was damaged and the driver side wheels were scratched. It killed me to see the damage. So I brought my car to Carlos and again he provided a prompt estimate and when I committed to getting the work done he managed to get my car in within a week and finished the job in several days. Carlos and his workers are polite, conscientious and dedicated to providing great quality service.",rating:5},{name:"Cinthia Guevara",review:"I was recommended to Carlos by a friend, very great work and prices.
